<p class="quote">
 Colours are never shapes, and shapes are never colors. But never is a colour found without a shape or a shape without a colour. There's a weird conspiracy in the universe. -Alan Watts
</p>

I strive to understand the roots of the universe. Be it through engineering, physics, mathematics, computers, statistics or any other science. My wish is to pursue the fundamental princples.  
I am a data-scientist by profession, and a noob to digital world populated with information.  
This blog is my way of sharing insights.
