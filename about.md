<p class="quote">
 Colours are never shapes, and shapes are never colors. But never is a colour found without a shape or a shape without a colour. There's a weird conspiracy in the universe. -Alan Watts
</p>

Every human activity is in pursuit of going beyond the physical limitaions, to experience the conspiracy and then break the paradox. Every breath is an opportunity.

I strive to understand the roots of the universe. Be it through engineering, physics, mathematics, computers, statistics or any other science. I have done my Masters in Automotive Engineering and Engineering Design, a field to purse just that, fundamental princples. Though I was never smart in the academic sense, there was never a time when I gave up on my curiosity or the method in the madness. I am a data-scientist by profession, taking steps to understand a digital world populated with information. This blog is my way of sharing insights.
