All is well when it ends well. But all goes well when it actually starts well. I'm a data-scientist, who's main profession is to *teach* data-science rather than *do* data-science. It is both exhilarating and terrifying that I have to teach something which I myself have picked a few months ago. Even more so given that I am awkward with situations involving social interactions. But experiences are things no one can buy, read or understand intellectually. They've got to be experienced. People magnify those which they do not understand and life is about moving from one side of the door to the other and realizing that there was no door after all. And so, this was a situation for me which pushed me from seeing a few things as a big deal to seeing them as just as mundane as the rest. I've learned great many things about myself and others in these few weeks. Here are some, which surprised me

##Everyone is terrified of everyone else
Yes, we are all humans. As much as I am ashamed to admit, I have my image to protect too. I hope I'll dissolve it someday. When the classes were going on, I was constantly on the back-foot. Defending every statement I was making, failing at it and admitting I was, after all, wrong. Every defeat I was accepting in front of the crowd was making me more and more vulnerable to judgment. What kind of a teacher admits he doesn't know his own subject matters? It was shameful at times. But what surprised me was that, at the near end of it, students were themselves trying to defend themselves and be felt as good-for-something. There was one, who said 'how are you still not bored with us?', when I was thinking to myself 'how are they not bored with me?'. Some believed that they were responsible for the dull class and they ought to participate more. Some believed there was too much information being thrown at them and they ought to not let themselves down and try to grasp as much subject as possible. They failed to understand their natural limits and employed themselves to be responsible for how much ever information is being thrown at them. They were trying to defend their own image of what they should do. The moment I was showing my gaps, there were students who would get busy judging and showing their superiority in asking questions (and miss the fact that the point of doubts is that they need to be annihilated), but the majority, were actually busy themselves defending their own statuses and protecting their own vulnerabilities. And there I was thinking I suck at my job, while many were thinking the same about themselves.

##There are all sorts of animals among Homo-Sapiens 
Some people are more confidant than others, and that is exactly what makes all the difference.
