title: Likelihood vs Probability
category: Statistics

Let's start the article with some intuition. In daily language, we use the words probability and likelihood quite interchangeably. I'm less likely to make a spelling mistake in this sentence, while also less probable to make a spelling mistake at the same time. It's more likely to rain today and hence less probable that it's not going to be sunny. Sounds easy right?


The probability of a fair coin to show heads is 0.5 where as the likelihood of a fair coin to show heads is ```<syntax error>```. Well? How likely _is_ it for a fair coin to show heads on a toss?


Let's try that again - The probability of a fair coin to show heads during a toss is 0.5, while the likelihood of a fair coin to show heads during a fair toss is _as much as_ the likelihood of a fair coin to show _tails_ during a toss. Now that makes sense!
