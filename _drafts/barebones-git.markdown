Many people I know confuse git with github, and probably don't have a good idea of how powerful version control is. I guess, half the trouble with it is the steepness of the learning curve, not to mention how wonky even the concept of version control is. I've had my own million doubts in using git and never knew where to start. Even if I did start, I'd have given up on the second day not understanding why certain thing is the way it is.

This post is just for that, to de-mistify what a good tool git is and how easy it is to integrate into the workflow and, really, master version control with only a handful of commands. I hope the days of copy-pasting a file in the name of 'backup' are a days of the past.

## Firstly...
Git is a version control software, created by [Linus Torvalds](https://www.linux.com/blog/10-years-git-interview-git-creator-linus-torvalds), the founder of Linux. Github, on the other hand is a neat platform to share and store code along with all the goodness of git. Github is by default a free platform at the cost of hosting the contents for public visibility and there's a paid service to have propitiatory codes stored online. Even though git can seamlessly integrate with Github, it is also compatible with other code sharing platforms, or just any location for that matter (ftp or shared networks, included)
