Back in the days when neither of us were born, science was a pioneering concept destined to take humanity from the shore of darkness to light. The selling point was this - repeatability. Careful reproduction of experiments ensured that a lot of falsifiable theories stayed false. But, the method falls flat when there is an unfalsifiable hypothesis in picture. The ignorant use science to say,

Enter our lord, god and the savior of sanity - Bayes.

Using science, instead of believing that someone had magical powers one could verify what is going on with experiments and come up with (one or more) suitable hypothesis that can be challenged by the successive generations to come thereby making sure that the progress is only ahead and not backward. But apart from the click-bait-y argument that I used in the first paragraph, there is an issue that cannot be dealt with, using experiments. And that is multiple hypotheses which explain the data.
