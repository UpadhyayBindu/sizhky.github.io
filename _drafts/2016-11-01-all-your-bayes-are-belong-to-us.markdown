Back in the days when neither of us were born, science was a pioneering concept destined to take humanity from the shore of darkness to light. The selling point was this - repeatability. Careful reproduction of experiments ensured that a lot of falsifiable theories stayed false. But, the method falls flat when there is an unfalsifiable hypothesis in picture. Science can never prove a hypothesis right, it can only prove it wrong. The ignorant - armed with this fact - use science to say:

> "Evolution is just a theory. It could be God as well and you can't prove me wrong!".  

If everything is 'just a theory' then which one is the right theory?

Using science, instead of believing that someone had magical powers one could verify what is going on with experiments and come up with (one or more) suitable hypothesis that can be challenged by the successive generations to come thereby making sure that the progress is only ahead and not backward. But apart from the click-bait-y argument that I used in the first paragraph, there is an issue that cannot be dealt with multiple hypotheses which fit the data. 

Let us work with a thought experiment. I have a dice whose number of faces is for you to figure out. What I will tell you is this - when I rolled the dice 10 times the following numbers showed up - *1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 4, 6, 4, 7, 4*.  
Take your time to solve the problem.

***

The dice must have at least 7 faces or else we would never have seen a seven in our data. Technically speaking we've done a bayesian update without even knowing what it means!  
Let's take a step back and solve the problem the right way, the bayesian way.  Before we've even seen the data all we could've told is that the dice can have the number of faces as any integer between 2 and infinity.
